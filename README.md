# COGS118A Project on predicting the final purchase decisions of consumers based on their online shopping behaviors

## Abstract
With the shift to digital life, online shopping becomes the major source of consumer consumption for its convenient features and personalized settings. It would be highly profitable if we can learn the patterns and attribution of consumer purchase decisions either for companies to predict and increase profits or to further personalize consumer experiences. Thus, in our project, we aim to predict the final purchase decisions of consumers based on their shopping behaviors. We employ the “Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention” dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository measuring various aspects of consumer shopping behaviors including time-spent on page, number of pages browsed, special days influence, etc. Then we apply various machine learning models such as logistic regression, K-NN, and decision trees to fit the data and use confusion matrix and classification accuracy as the metrics to evaluate the performance of our models.
