    "## Abstract \n",
    "With the shift to digital life, online shopping becomes the major source of consumer consumption for its convenient features and personalized settings. It would be highly profitable if we can learn the patterns and attribution of consumer purchase decisions either for companies to predict and increase profits or to further personalize consumer experiences. Thus, in our project, we aim to predict the final purchase decisions of consumers based on their shopping behaviors. We employ the “Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention” dataset from UCI Machine Learning Repository measuring various aspects of consumer shopping behaviors including time-spent on page, number of pages browsed, special days influence, etc. Then we apply various machine learning models such as logistic regression, K-NN, and decision trees to fit the data and use confusion matrix and classification accuracy as the metrics to evaluate the performance of our models."

    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "As people are more prone to spending time on shopping online rather than physical shopping in the mall, there are astronomical amounts of merchants deciding to sell their products online or hybrid to gain more profits/ for marketing reasons. Specifically, people choose websites/Apps like Amazon, Ebay, Instacart, etc. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the condition of quarantine, many people purchase things on their phone/electrical devices and get them delivered. No matter in what case, voluntarily or involuntarily, online shopping becomes both recreational and convenient tools for the customers. While the customers tried to benefit from the online shopping, the online stores needed to target more customers and analyze their behaviors to maximize their benefits. Thus an evaluation process of whether the customers will purchase the product or not becomes the core question the businesses want to answer. As mentioned in *Performance Study of Classification Algorithms for Consumer Online Shopping Attitudes and Behavior Using Data Mining, data mining including the machine learning* has been useful in “to help online shopping stores to identify online customer behavior to recommend for him the appropriate products he/she is interesting to them” <a name=\"rana\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#rananote). Machine learning has been used as a quantitative solution to the question on how the merchants decide whether the customers will purchase the item or not based on their behaviors. Using classification to detect the patterns of the customer's purchasing intention will benefit the purchase rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, many other machine learning algorithms have been prevalent in answering the question on how to determine the customer’s purchasing intentions. In *Real-time prediction of online shoppers’ purchasing intention using multilayer perceptron and LSTM recurrent neural networks*, they fed the informational data into algorithms such as random forest, multilayer perceptron and support vector machines<a name=\"sakar\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#sakarnote). No matter what algorithms are being used, they all aim to predict the intention behind purchaser’s behaviors to change merchant’s e-commerce strategies to double win. Combined with the two papers, they used both supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms. For example, in *Web usage mining to improve the design of an e-commerce website: OrOliveSur.com*, they tried to use these machine learning algorithms to achieve the better design of the e-commerce website to attract more customers to purchase the items<a name=\"carmona\"></a>[<sup>[3]</sup>](#carmonanote).\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the existing studies on online shoppers intention study, customers can get a sense of how they can improve their e-commerce websites and strategies to benefit their customers’ shopping experience while they can also get profits at the same time. In our study of prediction of online shopper’s intentions, by predicting whether they purchase the items or not using multiple supervised machine learning algorithms, the merchants could provide further solutions/revisions to the current e-commerce system."

    "- UCI Machine Learning Repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset#)\n",
    "    - It contains 12,330 observations where each observation belongs to a different user in a one-year period to avoid the tendency to a specific campaign, day, user profile, or period. \n",
    "    - It has 18 variables where 17 of them represents the information about a particular customer, such as if this customer is viewing this page at a special holiday, or how long this customer spent on this page; the \"Revenue\" variable represents whether this customer made a purchase, which will be the label for our model. \n",
    "        1. Administrative: The number of pages of administrative that the user visited.\n",
    "        2. Administrative_Duration: The amount of time spent in Administrative pages.\n",

    "        4. Informational_Duration: The amount of time spent in Informational pages.\n",
    "        5. ProductRelated: The number of pages of product related that the user visited.\n",
    "        6. ProductRelated_Duration: This is the amount of time spent in ProductRelated pages.\n",
    "        7. BounceRates: The percentage of visitors who enter the website through that page and exit without triggering any additional tasks.\n",
    "        8. ExitRates: The percentage of pageviews on the website that end at that specific page.\n",
    "        9. PageValues: The average value of the page averaged over the value of the target page and/or the completion of an eCommerce\n",
    "        10. SpecialDay: The closeness of the browsing date to special days or holidays (eg Mother's Day or Valentine's day) in\n",
    "        11. Month: The month the pageview occurred, in string form.\n",
    "        12. OperatingSystems: An integer value representing the operating system that the user was on when viewing the page.\n",
    "        13. Browser: An integer value representing the browser that the user was using to view the page.\n",
    "        14. Region: An integer value representing which region the user is located in.\n",
    "        15. TrafficType: An integer value representing what type of traffic the user is categorized into.\n",
    "        16. VisitorType: A string representing whether a visitor is New Visitor, Returning Visitor, or Other.\n",
    "        17. Weekend: A boolean representing whether the session is on a weekend.\n",
    "        18. Revenue: A boolean representing whether or not the user completed the purchase.\n",

    "## Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, we aim to predict if the consumer would make a purchase based on the dataset featuring multiple aspects of online shopping behavior. We will employ 4 different machine learning models: logistic regression, K-NN, decision trees, and SVMs (other proper models may be employed after exploration). The deliberate decision of choosing those 4 models stems from the fact that the dataset contains 17 numeric input variables and 1 categorical output variable. Thus, only classification models such as K-NN, decision trees and SVMs would be considered. In addition, considering the binary nature of output values, logistic regression seems viable too. The main coding component would involve sklearn, such as LogisticRegression from sklearn.linear_model, KNeighborsClassifier from sklearn.neighbors, DecisionTreeClassifier from sklearn.tree, and SVC from sklearn.svm. We will then compare the performance of each model to determine the best fit for the dataset using a confusion matrix as stated below. "

    "## Evaluation Metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "We will apply the confusion matrix, which gives us a matrix as output and describes the complete performance of the model. In the confusion matrix, every row will be ground truth and every column will be the prediction. We can calculate the recall and precision value to evaluate the relationship between the true feature and predicted feature. Recall is the measure for how many true feature get predicted out of all the feature case in the dataset while precision is the measure of the correctness of a feature prediction.\n",
    "* For example, for feature \"Weekend\", recall is the measure for how many true \"Weekend\" get predicted out of all the \"Weekend\" case in the dataset while precision is the measure of the correctness of the \"Weekend\" prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, classification accuracy will be the major evaluation metric in this project, which is the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of input samples. \n",
    "* For example, we will use model selection to split our training and testing sets into two sets of X and Y, where X is the set of features on customers behavior and days and Y is the result of whether customers purchase or not. After we generate our predictions using models, we will print out the classification report using sklearn.metrics packages to see the accuracy result of the predictions compared to the testing Y."
